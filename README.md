### Three observable Trends
1. Base on the Bubble chart,there is correlation between Total Number of Riders per City and Average Fares, the more riders in a city, the lower average fares.
2. Cities which type is rural have less riders and drivers then suburban and urban, but the highest average fares.
3. The more drivers a city has, the averge fares is lower.
